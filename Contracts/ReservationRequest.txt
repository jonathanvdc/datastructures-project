class ReservationRequest
// A request for a reservation.
// Reservation requests are not permanent and do not have an ID.
// Remarks:
// Reservation requests are intended to be an easy way to create a reservation: the client only has to fill in the data fields, and need not concern itself with the number of remaining seats or the hassle of generating a unique identifier.
// Also, their none-permanent nature allows them to be disposed of without consequences if anything goes wrong while processing the reservation.
