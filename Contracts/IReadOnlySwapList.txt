class IReadOnlySwapList<T> : IReadOnlyList<T>
// Describes a generic read-only list that uses a list of the same element type as backing storage.
// This backing list can be swapped with another list.
// Remarks:
// A read-only swap list's backing list can be changed by the client, but its elements cannot be modified by the client.
// It may seem like this creates obvious loophole for list modification, as the client could retain a reference to the backing list.
// The loophole is not reliable, however, as the class that contains the 'IReadOnlySwapList<T>' can also change the swap list's backing storage.
// Thus, depending on said loophole could leave the client thinking they have a reference to the swap list's backing storage, even though they do in fact not.
{

    +Swap(in Container : IList<T>)
    // Swaps the swap list's backing storage with the provided list.
    // Pre:
    // 'Container' should be an empty list.
    // Post:
    // The swap list's backing list is set to list 'Container'.
    // If 'Container' is not empty, the swap list may clear it.
    // Remarks:
    // This method cannot be used to reliably insert new items in the swap list, as 'Container' may be cleared by the swap list.
