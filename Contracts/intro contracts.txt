Operation contracts intro, by Jonathan Van der Cruysse, Informatica Ba 1, s0142476

Information on the operation contracts:

- The contents of a class are unambiguously displayed by using curly braces ('{', '}') to enclose them.

- The "property" keyword implies a property declaration: it contains "accessor" methods, such as get and set,
  which can be called by using attribute/field syntax.
  For example,
  property foo
  {
      +get() : integer { query }
      +set(in value : integer)
  }

  is a construct whose get accessor can be called like so:
  val = item.foo
  and whose set accessor can be called like this:
  item.foo = val

  In Python, properties are implemented by making use of the @property decorator.
  Properties are useful for ADTs because they do not force the implementation to declare a field, instead specifying that a number of accessor methods should be implemented.

- Indexers, prefixed by the "indexer" keyword, are analoguous to properties, and are accessed by using the typical indexing syntax:
  indexer
  {
       +get(in index : integer) : integer { query }
  }

  is a construct whose get accessor can be called like so:
  val = item[0]

  In Python, indexers are implemented by overriding __getitem__ and __setitem__

- Types that start with 'I', such as 'IList<T>' are named as such because they do not have a constructor defined: they themselves cannot be instantiated.
  Instead, a derived class must declare such a constructor. 'I' is short for interface.

- Generic class declarations, such as 'IList<T>', represents a class that offers type safety, and can still be used for any kind of types.
  For example, an 'IList<integer>' is not of the same type as a 'IList<string>'.
  An important feature of generics is that it is perfectly legal to call 'list.Add(5)' where 'list' is of type 'IList<integer>',
  whereas 'list.Add("5")' would be illegal, as "5" is a string, and the 'Add' method is defined in terms of the generic type parameter 'T' in 'IList<T>'
  It would be a legal method call if 'list' were of type 'IList<string>'.

- Constructors are prefixed with 'Create', whereafter the type name is appended. They have their declaring type as return type, and are typically marked as { query }, 
  because they do not change any global state, and their behavior is independent of said global state.
