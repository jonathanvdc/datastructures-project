class IReadOnlyCollection<T> : iterable<T>
// Describes a generic read-only collection of items.
// Remarks:
// To unify identical functionality across different collection-like ADTs, such as the table, list or sorted list, this interface is introduced.
// ADTs such as these should inherit read-only collection functionality from this, rather than specifying their own version of said functionality.
// Every read-only collection must implement the '__iter__' method in Python, as specified by the 'iterable<T>' base type.
// Implementing this allows using the for loop statement on any read-only collection.
// The exact contracts of 'iterable<T>' and '__iter__' are omitted here, as they are both platform-specific means of enabling a platform-agnostic pattern.
// Instead, 'iterable<T>' is defined as a base type that supports the use of a for loop on the collection.
