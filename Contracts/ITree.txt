class ITree<T, TKey> : iterable<T>
// Describes a generic search tree.
// This is a generalization of a binary search tree that is also applicable to 2-3 trees, 2-3-4 trees, black-red trees and AVL trees.
// Remarks:
// Every implementation of ITree<T, TKey> must also implement the '__iter__' method, which is implied by the 'iterable<T>' base type.
// See the 'IReadOnlyCollection<T>' contract for a detailed explanation of what 'iterable<T>' entails.

    property KeyMap
    {

        +get() : IMap<T, TKey> { query }
        // Gets the function that maps the search tree's records to their search keys.

    }

    property Count
    {

        +get() : integer { query }
        // Counts the number of items in the search tree.

    }

    property IsEmpty
    {

        +get() : boolean { query }
        // Gets a boolean value that indicates if the list is empty.

    }

    +Insert(in Item : T)
    // Inserts an item in the search tree.
    // Post:
    // The item will be added to the tree, regardless of whether the tree already contains an item with the same search key.

    +Retrieve(in Key : TKey) : T { query }
    // Retrieves the item with the specified key.
    // Post:
    // If the search tree contains an item with the specified key, said item is returned.
    // If not, None is returned.

    +Remove(in Key : TKey) : boolean
    // Removes the item with the specified key from the search tree.
    // Post:
    // If the search tree contains an item with the provided key, it is removed, and true is returned.
    // Otherwise, the tree's state remains unchanged, and false is returned.

    +TraverseInorder() : IReadOnlyList<T> { query }
    // Performs inorder traversal on the binary search tree and writes its items to a new list.
    // Post:
    // This method returns a read-only list with element type 'T' that can be used for iteration.
